# Official xScarlife Farming Routes (Retail)

This page contains all the farming routes I made myself to use in combination with the Routes addon. Please note that you are NOT allowed to share my farming routes on the internet without my permission. I made these routes to help out the World of Warcraft community.

There are two ways how you can install these farming routes. There is a manual way and an automatic way. I stick with the automatic way to make things easier.

You can watch my video where I explain how you can import my farming routes automatically here: https://youtu.be/h9vRYZWlrWk.


Written instructions:
1) Download the 'Routes' and the 'Routes Import & Export' addons.
2) Download the farming route export string you would like to use in-game from my Github page.
3) To import a route copy the export string from the text file, open the "Routes" window (console command /routes) and select the "Routes" section. You can see a new Import text box. 
4) Paste the route string to import (Ctrl+V) and click the Accept button. 
5) Your route should now be correctly imported.
