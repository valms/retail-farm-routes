Pyrite is the rarest and most valuable ore in Cataclysm. Itâ€™s also smelted into Pyrium Bars by Miners and sold to Blacksmiths to be combined with Volatile Fire, Air and Water to make Truegold which is an extremely valuable trade good. To obtain Pyrite Ore just follow the route for the Elementium Ore in Twilight Highlands. While mining those you should also have a chance to loot Pyrite Ore.
